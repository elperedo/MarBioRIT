## Software
We will use the software on RIT bioinformatic servers for most of our data processing and analyses.  To interact with the servers you will need:
1. A terminal to connect to the servers
2. A program to transfer files from and to your computer

How to connect in FileZilla

* Open the new site icon (just under File)
* Select ssh connection
* Port 22
* Fill in the RIT connection data.

## Install/Activate a terminal
### mac

A full terminal, compatible with unix system is pre-installed. 
You can find detailed instructions for Mac users [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac). 
https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac

**copy and paste inside the terminal**
note: you can copy and paste using cmd + V, but if this doesnt work use cmd+shift+v or use crt+shift+ c and crt+shift+ v

:::warning
Most Mac users have default zsh terminal shells where * (asterisk) does not work, which causes issues when doing secure copying. The solution here is to switch from zsh shell to the bash shell.

* Type chsh -s /bin/bash on your LOCAL machine terminal
* Then the terminal will prompt you to enter your Mac password
* Quit the terminal and reopen that should make it work
* We can also double-check if we're on bash shell now by typing echo $SHELL. If we get /bin/bashâ€‹, that means we are on bash shell and we can use * now!

### Windows

Windows does not have a native terminal. You need to activate or install it. You can find detailed instructions on how to install an ubuntu terminal in win 10 [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/).

In brief, go here and activate the Windows Subsystems for Linux
![](https://i.imgur.com/oiB3Dq1.png)

Now go to the store and download Linux, I recommend Ubuntu (e.g. 20.04 or 22.04 or 24.04)

The easiest way to work with this linux partition locally is to create a direct access so you can easily copy and paste files. 

Useful shortcuts:

how to find your files (your computer files)

`cd /mnt/c`
That is your C drive. Your files would be under Users, your username. 

How to **copy & paste** in the terminal in ubuntu in windows OS. 
By default, it might be set to use the right button of the mouse to paste after copying. I would recommend setting the terminal to use the same shortcuts the other students would be using.
To do this in an open Ubuntu window click on the upper left corner,  in the terminal app go to Defaults -> Check on Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste -> Click Ok. 


### Linux
If you are running Linux, you are probably pretty familiar with the terminal. If not, check [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it).
https://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it

To **copy and paste inside the terminal** use crt+shift+ c and crt+shift+ v

## secure file transfer 

We will be working remotely most of the time using a HPC (high performance cluster, that is a much more powerful computer than your own)

It's worth installing a graphical interface that will let you move files around the way you're probably used to.  We recommend FileZilla. 

### FileZilla client
Download the appropriate version of the program (**client version**) 

[Win64bit](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64)
[Win32bit](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win32)

[MAC OSX](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=osx)

[linux64](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=linux64)
[linux32](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=linux32)

webpage: https://filezilla-project.org/

Once installed you justneed to configure the access to the remote computer and from there you would be able to move files back and forth easily.

## text editor (Visual Code Studio)
:::danger
Do not copy commands in word. ever. 
:::

Copying commands from Word or other sophisticated word processors to the terminal leads to all sorts of problems.  You'll want to use a simple text editor.
One nice text editor is Visual Code Studio, which combines a folder-based interface and text edition capabilities. 
https://code.visualstudio.com/download


It can be seamlessly integrated with the desktop version of [github](https://desktop.github.com/). Scripts and comments from this class can also be found on Github, https://github.com/elperedo/Microbiomes-Across-Environments


## Additional text editors.

### windows 
Windows has [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad) 

### mac 
Mac has [text edit](https://support.apple.com/guide/textedit/welcome/mac). Just follow the instructions [here](https://www.techjunkie.com/textedit-plain-text-mode/#:~:text=TextEdit%20opens%20a%20new%20document,in%20the%20TextEdit%20menu%20bar.) to make it plain text so that copying to the terminal goes smoothly.

### Linux
you can use [text edit](www.gedit.org) from gedit. It is a small and lightweight text editor for the GNOME Desktop.


## Documenting your project

It is important to store your code, so that
1. You (or anyone else) can repeat your analysis. 
2. We can help you to troubleshoot any problem that you might encounter.

This is part of your grading for this course. We will guide you through each analysis step, but we want you to document all the steps you took to arrive at your conclusions. 

We **strongly encourage you not to use** Word (.docx) or other sophisticated word processing programs to save your code. These programs embed many additional lines of code that will be misinterpreted by the terminal and the programs you will be using. Even "saving as" a text file may not remove all these symbols.
:::success
I recommend you use a text editor such as Visual Code or even websites such as this one, [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) or [Github](https://github.com/)
